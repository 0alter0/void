# void
A simple Meteor Client addon (FEATURES STILL BEING MADE, I'LL ADD ALL FILES ON FIRST RELEASE!)


# What this is
A Meteor Client addon that's mainly for rendering.

Current (planned) features:
- StructureESP (Requires world seed)
- .structure (allows you to search for the closest structure type from your pos)
- FloatingTreeESP (would be VERY laggy on old or popular servers)
- BaritoneTunnelFinder (Maybe, if i can figure something out)
- PredictionLines (somehow make a prediction algorithm that tries to predict where a player will move next)
- MobPredictionLines (using that one dude's discoveries with the AI pathfinding stuff)
- Radius (shows the radius of damage is next to things that can explode)
- DespawnTimer (this may be limited by server stuff but most likely possible)

  How would the BTF (BaritoneTunnelFinder) work? From my use of Baritone, it seems like it has a weird way of tunneling, so that may be a possible thing to render
