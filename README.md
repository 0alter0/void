# void
A simple Meteor Client addon (FEATURES STILL BEING MADE, I'LL ADD ALL FILES ON FIRST RELEASE!)


# What this is
A Meteor Client addon that's for things I wished Meteor itself or other addons had.

Current (planned) features:
- StructureESP (Requires world seed)
- .structure (allows you to search for the closest structure type from your pos)
- FloatingTreeESP (would be VERY laggy on old or popular servers)
- BaritoneTunnelFinder (Maybe, if i can figure something out)  <----- MAYBE
- PredictionLines (somehow make a prediction algorithm that tries to predict where a player will move next)
- MobPredictionLines (using that one dude's discoveries with the AI pathfinding stuff)
- Radius (shows the radius of damage is next to things that can explode)
- DespawnTimer (this may be limited by server stuff but most likely possible)
- BaritoneDetector (attempts to detect if a player is using baritone by their movements, camera movement, "robotic-ness," etc...)
- AutoTreeJump (if there is a leave block right above the player, then spam jump)
- AutoMLG (may be hard to make, but if you fall like 10 blocks, then take a water bucket and click right below you)
- SeedCracker (if i'm smart enough, add a seed cracker based off structures or features) <----- MAYBE

How would the BTF (BaritoneTunnelFinder) work? From my use of Baritone, it seems like it has a weird way of tunneling, so that may be a possible thing to render

# Baritone Features
These MAY be implemented, not a guarantee

- BetterLines (each line could display some way better info)
- TakeAndPutInChest (takes items, puts them in a chest)
- YCoordAdjust (if you get the "wrong y coord" error, then build up or dig down)
- RunAway (simply runs away from players and/or entities)
- Pearl (allows baritone to use pearls)
