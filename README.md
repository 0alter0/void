# void
A simple Meteor Client addon (FEATURES STILL BEING MADE, I'LL ADD ALL FILES ON FIRST RELEASE!)


# What this is
A Meteor Client addon that's mainly for rendering.

Current (planned) features:
- StructureESP (Requires world seed)
- FloatingTreeESP
- BaritoneTunnelFinder (Maybe, if i can figure something out)

  How would the BTF (BaritoneTunnelFinder) work? From my use of Baritone, it seems like it has a weird way of tunneling, so that may be a possible thing to render
